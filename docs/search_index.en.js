updaters are essentially used as \"wrappers\" around a volatile field\n(primitive or object reference). They are generally used when one or both of the following are true:\n\nYou generally want to refer to the variable \"normally\" (that is, without having to always refer to it via the get or set methods on the atomic classes) but occasionally need an atomic  get-set operation (which you can't do with a normal volatile field);\nYou are going to create a large number of objects of the given type, and don't want every single instance to have to have an extra object embeded in it just for atomic access.\n\nAn example of the first kind is BufferedInputStream. Every instance of BufferedInputStream\ncontains an internal buffer, defined as a volatile byte array. Generally speaking, BufferedInputStream just\nneeds to refer this array \"normally\" for the purpose of reading/writing bytes. However, an atomic\nget-and-set operation is needed in specific places where the buffer array is replaced (either to\ngrow it or to mark it as null or closed), because closure can occur in a different thread to that\nperforming the reads. One option would have been to declare the buffer variable as a AtomicReference to an array, and always get and set the array via this variable. But that would be a bit\nmessy. Instead, a normal volatile array variable is used, and the class also contains a static\nAtomicReferenceUpdater as follows:\nstatic AtomicReferenceFieldUpdater\n    bufUpdater = AtomicReferenceFieldUpdater.newUpdater(BufferedInputStream.class,\n    byte[].class, \"buf\");\n\nThe array itself still remains a normal (volatile) variable, and reads and writes from the array\ncan use normal array syntax. But when necessary, via the field updater, an atomic comparae-and-set\noperation can be performed on the volatile variable. Although the update is static, each instance\nof BufferedInputStream has its own buffer of course. So when we perform the CAS operation, we\nneed to pass into the updater the actual object whose variable we want to affect:\nif (bufUpdater.compareAndSet(this, oldbuffer, newBuffer)) {\n  ...\n}\n\n","id":"https://randominit.xyz/notes/atomic-field-updaters/","title":"Atomic field updaters"},"https://randominit.xyz/notes/column-oriented-storage/":{"body":"What is Column-Oriented Storage? In Contrast to Row-Oriented Storage, each column of data is stored in\na seperate file, and all the column files store rows in the same order.\nColumn Compression\nValues in a column often look quite repetitive, so they can be compressed.\nBitmap Encoding\nwe can take a column with n distinct values and turn it into n separate bitmaps: one bitmap for each distinct value, with one bit for each row. The bit is 1 if the row has that value, and 0 if not.\nRun-length encoding\nIn run-length encoding, a sequence of \"0, 4, 12, 2\" stands for 0 zeros, 4 ones, 12 zeros, 2 ones.\nUsing bitmap encoding, bitwise operation can be use to speed up queries.\nColumn families are row-oriented: within each column family, they store all columns from a row\ntogether, along with a row key, and they do not use column compression.\nMemory bandwitdth and vectorized processing\nColumn compression allows more rows from a column to fit in the same amount of L1 cache. Operators, such as bitwise AND and OR, can be designed to operate on such chunks of compressed column data directly.\nSort Order in Column Storage\nWe can choose to impose an order on rows, and use that as an indexing mechanism. A second column can determine the sort order of any rows that have the same value in the first column. Another advantage of sorted\norder is that it can help with compression of columns.\nSeveral different sort orders\nDifferent queries benefit from different sort orders, so why not store the same data sorted in several different ways?

Writing to a volatile field has the same memory effect\nas a monitor release, and reading from a volatile field has the same memory\neffect as a monitor acquire. In effect, because the new memory model places\nstricter constraints on reordering of volatile field accesses, volatile or not,\nanything that was visible to thread A when it writes to volatile field f becomes\nvisible to thread B when it reads f.\nclass VolatileExample {\n    int x = 0;\n    volatile boolean v = false;\n    public void writer() {\n        x = 42;\n        v = true;\n    }\n    public void reader() {\n        if (v == true) {\n            // uses x - guaranteed to see 42, even though x is not volatile\n            // because anything that was visible to thread A when it writes\n            // to volatile field v becomes visible to thread B when it reads v\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nImportant Note: Note that it is important for both threads to access\nthe same volatile variable in order to properly set up the happens-before relationship. It is not the case that everything visible to thread A when it writes to volatile\nfield f becomes visible to thread B after it reads volatile field g.\n","id":"https://randominit.xyz/notes/java-memory-model/","title":"Java Memory Model"},"https://randominit.xyz/notes/leader-based-replication/":{"body":"In Leader Based Replication, one node is designated as the leader, which receives write requests from clients, writes the new data to its local storage and also sends the data to all of its followers.\nSynchronous Versus Asychronous Replication\n\nSynchronous\n\nAdvantage: The follower is guaranteed to have an up-to-date copy of the data that is consistent with the leader.\nDisadvantage: If the synchronous follower does not respond, all writes will be blocked.\nTypically, synchronous means one of the follower is synchronous and if the synchoronous follower becomes unavailable or slow, one of the\nasynchronous followers is made synchronous.

This makes replication closely coupled to the storage engine.\n\n\nLogical (row-based) log replication\n\nA logical log for a relational database is usually a sequence of records describing writes to database tables at the granularity of a row.\n\n\nTrigger-based replication\nRegister custom application code that is automatically executed when a data change occures.\n\n\nProblems with Replication Lag\n\nReading Your Own Writes\n\nWhen reading something that the user may have modified, read it from the leader.\nTrack the time of the last update and, for one minute after the last update, make all reads from the leader.\nThe client can remember the timestamp (logical or actual system clock) of its most recent write - then the system can ensure that the replica serving any reads for that user reflects updates at least until that timestamp.\n\nAnother complication arises when the same user is accessing your service from multiple devices. In this case you may want to provide cross-device read-after-write consistency. In this case, there are some additional issues to consider:\nApproaches that require remembering the timestamp of the user's last update become more difficult, because code running on one device doesn't know what updates have happened on the other device. This metadata will need to be centralized\n\n\nMonotonic Reads\nThe issue is if a user first reads from fresh replica, then from a stale replica, Time appears to go backward.\n\nMake sure each user always read from the same replica.\nConsistent Prefix Reads\n\n\n\nConsistent prefix reads guarantees that if a sequence of writes happens in a certain order, then anyone reading those writes will see them in the same order.\n\nOne solution is to make sure that any wirtes that are causally related to each other are written to the same partition.\nSolutions for Replication Lag\n","id":"https://randominit.xyz/notes/leader-based-replication/","title":"Leader Based Replication"},"https://randominit.xyz/notes/linearizability/":{"body":"What is linearizability?

An important point is that when await() returns,\nit only indicates that the condition might be true. so we need to go back and\nrecheck whether the condition is true.\nFrom my understanding, the advantage of condition is that we can use signal() and await() to get some coordination between threads, instead of trying\nto acquire the lock blindly.\nHow can we solve the Dining Philosoper problem using condition?

So, instead, we associate a condition\nwith each of the philosoper, and the condition only means the philosoper may\ngo ahead to try to eat, but it's not guaranteed that both of the chopsticks\nare available. When a philosoper finishes eating, he needs to singal both the\nphilosoper on his left and the philosoper on his right. In order to eat, a\nphilosoper needs to make sure that both pholosopers on his left and his right\nis not eating.\nFairness\nIf fairness parameter is set to true, under contention, locks favor granting access to the\nlongest-waiting thread.

Note however, that fairness\nof locks does not guarantee fairness of thread scheduling.

Here, for example, is a\nclass that downloads from a URL and allows ProgressListeners to be registered:\nclass Downloader extends Thread {\n    private InputStream in;\n    private OutputStream out;\n    private ArrayList listeners;\n\n    public Downloader(URL url, String outputFilename) throws IOException {\n        in = url.openConnection().getInputStream();\n        out = new FileOutputStream(outputFilename);\n        listeners = new ArrayList();\n    }\n    public synchronized void addListener(ProgressListener listener) {\n        listeners.add(listener);\n    }\n    public synchronized void removeListener(ProgressListener listener) {\n        listeners.remove(listener);\n    }\n    private synchronized void updateProgress(int n) {\n        for (ProgressListener listener: listeners)\n            listener.onProgress(n);\n    }\n}\n\n\nBecause addListener(), removeListener(), and updateProgress() are all synchronized, multiple\nthreads can can them without stepping on one another's toes. But a trap lurks in this code\nthat could leak to deadlock enev though there's only a single lock in use.\nThe problem is that updateProgress() calls an alien method - a method it knows nothing about.\nThat method could do anything, including acquiring another lock. If it does, then we've\nacquired two locks without knowing whether we've done so in the right order. That can lead to\ndeadlock.\nThe only solution is to avoid calling alien methods while holding a lock. One way to achieve\nthis is to make a defensive copy of listeners before iterating through it:\nprivate void updateProgress(int n) {\n    ArrayList listenersCopy;\n    synchronized(this) {\n        listenersCopy = listeners.clone();\n    }\n    for (ProgressListener listener: listenersCopy)\n        listener.onProgress(n);\n}\n\nThis change kills several birds with one stone. Not only does it avoid calling an alien\nmethod with a lock held, it also minimizes the period during which we hold the lock. Holding\nlocks for longer than necessary both hurts performance (by restricting the degree of achievable concurrency) and increases the dange of deadlock. This change also fixes another buy that\nisn't related to concurrency - a listener can now call removeListener() within its onProgress() method without modifying the copy of listeners that's mid-iteration.\nTakeaway tips\n\nSynchronize all access to shared variables.\nBoth the writing and the reading threads need to use synchronization\nAcquire multile locks in a fixed, global order, and don't use hascode to determine the global order\nDon't call alien methods while holding a lock.\nHold locks for the shortest possible amount time.\n\n","id":"https://randominit.xyz/notes/things-to-avoid-when-using-locks/","title":"Tips on  Using Locks"},"https://randominit.xyz/notes/transactions/":{"body":"Transactions\nACID\nAtomicity\n\nAbortability, implemented using write ahead log\n\nConsistency\n\nSatisfy application defined invariant\n\nIsolation\n\nDifferent isolation levels\n\nDurability\nAtomic operations on single object\n\ncompare and set\natomic increment\n\nIsolation Levels\nRead committed\nProperties\n\nno dirty reads (only read commited result)\nno dirty writes (only override previously commited record)\n\nissues if dirty writes (Bob buy car but invoice sent to alice)\n\n\n\nImplementation\n\nuse locks to prevent concurrent writes\nkeep old value during writes, and return old value if there's a request\n\nSnapshot Isolation &amp; Repeatable Read\nProperties\nImplementation\n\nMVCC\n\nunique monotonically increasing transaction id\nvisibility rule\n\nAt the time when the reader's transaction started, the transaction that created the object had already committed.\nThe object is not marked for deletion, or if it is, the transaction that requested deletion had not yet committed at the time when the reader's transaction started.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndexes and snapshot isolation\n\nindex points to all versions of an object\nappend-only/copy-on-write\nevery write transaction (or batch of transactions) creates a new B-tree root, and a particular root is a consistent snapshot of the database at the point in time when it was created.\n\nSerializability\nHow to implement\n\n\nLiterally exectute transactions in a serial order\n\nevery transaction must be small and fast\nlimited to use cases where active data can fit in memory\nwrite throughput must be low enough to be handled on a single cpu core, or else\ntransactions need to be partitioned without requiring cross-partition coordination\ncross-partition transactions are possible, but there's a hard limit to the extent to which they can be used\n\n\n\nTwo-phase locking\n\nIn 2PL, writers don't just block other writers; they also block readers and vice versa\n\n\n\noptimistic concurrency control techniques\n\nDetecting stale MVCC reads\n\nthe database needs to track when a transaction ignores another transaction's writes due to MVCC visibility rules.
