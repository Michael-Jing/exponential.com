<h1>SSTables and LSM-Trees</h1>
<h1 id="sstables-and-lsm-trees">SSTables and LSM-Trees</h1>
<p>SStable stands for Sorted String Table, in which key sequence of key-value pairs is sorted by key.</p>
<ul>
<li>A compaction process is running in the background to merge SSTables and remove old values of keys. mergesort is used.</li>
<li>In memory index is sparse, keys between two consecutive indexed keys need to be scanned.</li>
<li>Since read requests need to scan over several key-value pairs in the requested range anyway, it is possible to group those records
into a block and compress it before writing it to disk.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="constructing-and-maintaining-sstables">Constructing and maintaining SSTables</h2>
<ol>
<li>When a write comes in, add it to an in-memory balanced tree data structure. This in-memory tree is sometimes called a memtable.</li>
<li>When the memtable gets bigger than some threshold, write it out to disk as an SSTable file.</li>
<li>In order to server a read request, first try to find the key in the memtable, then in on-disk segment</li>
<li>run a compaction process to combine segment files and discard overwritten or deleted values.</li>
<li>use a append log to recover from crash.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="making-an-lsm-tree-out-of-sstables">Making an LSM-tree out of SSTables</h2>
<ul>
<li>use Bloom filter to efficiently detect keys that does not exist</li>
<li>size-tiered and leveled compaction
<ul>
<li>size-tiered: newer and smaller SSTables are successively merged into older and larger SSTables.</li>
<li>leveled compaction: the key range is split up into smaller SSTables and older data is moved into separate 'levels'</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="b-trees">B-Trees</h1>
<h2 id="making-b-trees-reliable">Making B-trees reliable</h2>
<ul>
<li>write-ahead log (WAL)</li>
<li>protecting the tree's data structures with latches (lightweight locks)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="b-tree-optimizations">B-tree optimizations</h2>
<ul>
<li>copy-on-write. A modified page is witten to a different location, and a new version of the parent pages is created, pointing at the new location.</li>
<li>save space by abbreviating keys</li>
<li>additional pointers</li>
<li>borrow log-structured ideas</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="comparing-b-trees-and-lsm-trees">Comparing B-Trees and LSM-Trees</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>LSM-trees are typically faster for writes, whereas B-trees are thought to be faster for reads. Reads are typically slower on LSM-trees because they have to check several different data structures and SSTables at different stages of compaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need to test systems with particular workload in order to make a valid comparison.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advantages-of-lsm-trees">Advantages of LSM-trees</h2>
<p>write amplification: one write to the database resulting in multiple writes to the disk over the course of the database's lifetime.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In write-heavy applications, the performance bottleneck might be the rate at which the database can write to disk. The more that a storage engine writes to disk, the fewer writes per second it can handle within the available disk bandwidth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LSM-trees are typically able to sustain higher write throughput than B-trees, partly because they sometimes have lower write amplification (depends on the storage engine configuration and workload), and partly because they sequentially write SSTable files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LSM-trees can be compressed better</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SSD firmware may use a log-structured algorithm to turn random writes into sequential wirtes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="downsides-of-lsm-trees">Downsides of LSM-trees</h2>
<ul>
<li>The compaction process can sometimes interfere with the performance of ongoing reads and writes. the response time of queries to log-structured storage engines can sometimes be quite high</li>
<li>At high write throughput, the compaction may cannot keep up with the rate of incoming writes.</li>
<li>An advantage of B-trees is that each key exists in exactly one place, so transaction isolation is easier.</li>
</ul>
