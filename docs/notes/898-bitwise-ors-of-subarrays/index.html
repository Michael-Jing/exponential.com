<p>The problem:
We have an array of non-negative integers.
For every (contiguous) subarray B = [A[i], A[i+1], ..., A[j]]  (with i &lt;= j),
we take the bitwise OR of all the elements in B, obtaining a result A[i] | 
A[i+1] | ... | A[j].</p>
<p>Return the number of possible results. (Results that occur more than once ary only counted once
in the final answer.)</p>
<p>possible approaches:
of course the first thing come to my mind is the brute force approch, but I know that 
it barely the right way to go in such kind of problems, since if solve every problem
the brute force way, then way borther learning algorithms. </p>
<p>The next thing to try is some kind of prefix array to store the temporary results,
for example we can have a array, in which the element prefix[i] is the OR of all
the elements from the begining of the input array up to A[i], and then we can 
use prefix[i] and prefix[j] to compute the results for A[i] ... A[j]. However
this approach is not working in this problem.</p>
<p>Another approach(and the right approach for this problem)
Another approach is that we use a container to store the temporary results, and when
we see a new element n, we use |= to update each element in the container, and we
also add the new element n to the container, this is actually very like the prefix 
approch, in which we keep track of the results from the begining to a certain element,
but in this case, we keep track of the results from each of the elements before
a certain element to that element.</p>
