<h3 id="what-makes-a-system-linearizable">What Makes a System Linearizable</h3>
<ul>
<li>If a read request is concurrent with a write request, it may return either the old or the new value.</li>
<li>After any one read has returned the new value, all following reads (on the same or other clients) must also return the new value.</li>
<li>The requirement of linearizability is that the lines joining up the operation markers always move forward in time (from left to right), never backward. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linearizability-versus-serializability">Linearizability Versus Serializability</h3>
<ul>
<li>Serializability is an isolation nproperty of transacitons, where every transaction may read and write multiple objects</li>
<li>Linearizability is a recency guarantee on reads and writes of a register (an individual object). </li>
<li>A database may provide both serializability and linearizability, and this combination is known as strict serializability or strong one-copy serializability. </li>
<li>Implementations of serializability based on two-phase locking or actual serial execution are typically linearizable.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Single-leader replication (potentially linerizable)</li>
<li>Consensus algorithms (linearizable)</li>
<li>Multi-leader replication (not linearizable)</li>
<li>Leaderless replication (probably not linearizable)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-cost-of-linearizability">The Cost of Linearizability</h3>
<ul>
<li>CAP theorem</li>
<li>Linearizability is slow (even memory of multi-core cpu is not linearizable)</li>
