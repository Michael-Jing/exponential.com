<h1 id="what-i-learned-when-using-c">What I learned when using C++</h1>
<p>Recently I started  using the C++ programming language since I am learning the Udacity
Self-Driving-Car Nanodgree program Term2 and one of the projects is implementing an 
extended Kalman Filter in C++. I am writing to document the tricky part of C++ here that
I learned.</p>
<h1 id="not-dividing-by-zeros">Not Dividing by zeros</h1>
<p>Like in pure math and any other programing languages, dividing by zero is always a probaylem,
So we should avoid dividing by zeros. We probably will not write code like <code>some_variable / 0;</code> 
, the issue is that dividing by zeros will happen in functions we called if do not pay attention 
to the parameters we passed in, for example, in <code>py = 1; px = 0; atan2(py, px)</code>, a dividing by 
zeros error will occur.</p>
<h1 id="pay-attention-to-data-types">Pay attention to data types</h1>
<p>In my implementation of the extended Kalman filter, the result is not as expected in the 
beginning and I found that the issue arise from my calculation for  $$\Delta t$$ in the 
following code.</p>
<p><code>double dt = (current_timestamp - previous_timestamp) / 1000000</code></p>
<p>here both current_timestamp and previous_timestamp are long and their difference is 
always less than 1000000 since the measurement comes one after another within very short 
time, as a result dt will be zero always, this causes the kalman Filter to predict exactly 
the same state as the current and thus not doing a good work.</p>
<p>After I changed the code as the following, things start to work.</p>
<p><code>double dt = (double)(current_timestamp - previous_timestamp) / 1000000</code></p>
<p>or </p>
<p><code>double dt = (current_timestamp - previous_timestamp) / 1000000.0</code></p>
<p>please notice that</p>
<p><code>double dt = (current_timestamp - previous_timestamp) / 1000000L</code></p>
<p>is not working.</p>
