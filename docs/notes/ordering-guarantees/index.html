<h1>Ordering Guarantees</h1>
<h2 id="ordering-and-causality">Ordering and Causality</h2>
<ul>
<li>The causal order is not a total order</li>
<li>Linearizability is stronger than causal consistency
<br>
Causal consistency is the strongest possible consistency model that does not slow down due to network delays,
and remains available in the face of network failures.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sequence-number-ordering">Sequence Number Ordering</h2>
<p>It's easy if there's a single leader
<br></p>
<h3 id="noncausal-sequence-number-generators">Noncausal sequence number generators</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each node generate its own independent set of sequence numbers</li>
<li>Use time-of-day clock</li>
<li>Preallocate blocks of sequence numbers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lamport-timestamps-provides-total-ordering">Lamport timestamps (provides total ordering)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Each node has a unique identifier, and each node keeps a counter of the number of operations it has processed</li>
<li>The Lamport timestamp is a pair of (counter, node Id)</li>
<li>Every node and every client keeps track of the maximum counter value it has seen so far, and includes that maximum on every request. When a node receives a request or response with a maximum counter value greater than
its own counter value, it immediately increases its own counter to that maximum.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="timestamp-ordering-is-not-sufficient">Timestamp ordering is not sufficient</h3>
<p>unique username example, conflicts can only be detected after the fact.</p>
<h2 id="total-order-broadcast">Total Order Broadcast</h2>
<p>Total order broadcast is usually described as a protocal for exchanging messages between nodes. Informally, it requires that two safety properties always be satisfied:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reliable delivery:
<br>
No messages are lost: If a message is delivered to one node, it is delivered to all nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Totally ordered delivery
Messages are delivered to every node in the same order.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-linearizable-storage-using-total-order-broadcast">Implementing linearizable storage using total order broadcast</h3>
<p>Use the unique username problem as an example
<br></p>
<ol>
<li>Append a message to the log, tentatively indicating the username you want to claim.</li>
<li>Read the log, and wait for the message you appended to be delivered back to you</li>
<li>Check for any message claiming the username that you want. If the first message for your
desired username is your own message, then you are successful: you can commit the username claim
and acknowledge it to the cilent.
While the above procedure ensures linearizable writes, it doesn't guarantee linearizable reads.
<br> To make reads linearizable, there are a few options:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You can sequence reads through the log by appending a message, reading the log, and performing
the actual read when the message is delivered back to you.</li>
<li>If the log allows you to fetch the position of the latest log message in a linearizable way, you
can query that position, wait for all entries up to that position to be delivered, and then perform the read.</li>
<li>Read from a synchronously updated replica.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-total-order-broadcast-using-linearizable-storage">Implementing total order broadcast using linearizable storage</h3>
<p>You have a linearizable register that stores an integer and that has atomic increment-and-get operation.
for every message, you increment-and-get the linearizable integer, and then attach the value you got to the message
as a sequence number.</p>
<p>However, make a linearizable sequence number generator in a distributed environment needs a consensus algorithm.</p>
